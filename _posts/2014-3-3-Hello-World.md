I've been working with virtual machine for some time. Oracle's Virtual-Box and Microsoft's Hyper-Visor are the two big players i've spent most my time with but i've also experimented with VM-Ware, various Linux-based solutions, and countless cloud providers. Virtual computing has really begun to take off and i couldn't be happier!
